      <h2>Training Information</h2>

      <p>Train your body and mind. Tamiya Ryu is a koryu (literally, "old school") sword art not taught outside Japan until recently. The United States Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu Orgranization is the only official group practicing this art in America.</p>

      <p>Training focuses on the harmonization of mind, body, and spirit through the practice and performance of kata (pre-arranged techniques). Techniques are practiced with the philosophy of the "sword which gives life (Katsujin no Ken)," as opposed to the "sword which takes life (Satsujin no Ken)."</p>

      <p>Emphasis is placed on basic techniques. To properly learn kata means studying 1) how to cut using the scabbard opening (sayaguchi) and 2) how to use the scabbard hand (sayate).</p>

      <p>Occasionally students will also practice Kenshibu - a traditional Japanese dance utilizing sword and fan. Kenshibu is performed to the accompaniment of poems (sung in a style called Shigin) that depict famous events in Japanese history.</p>
